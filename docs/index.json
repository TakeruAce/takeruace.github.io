The second experiment showed that Unident can provide an impact sensation with various magnitudes depending on the amount of rotational inertia to be changed.

Listen to the voice of things and be grateful for their benefits. These beliefs were born because people and things have spun a close relationship. However, with the development of technology, people became arrogant, and the \u0026ldquo;ghost\u0026rdquo; in things was forgotten. Especially now that intelligence has been given to all things, human beings are becoming a one-sided subjective relationship with the side that commands and the side that commands things. Such a apathetic relationship even makes things feel bothersome. When you listen to the voices of things and think about the feelings of things, it\u0026rsquo;s the first time that things have life.\nThis work breaks down the relationship between people and things and depicts a world where \u0026ldquo;ghost\u0026rdquo; dwells in things.

In this project, we developed a handheld VR controller \u0026ldquo;Transcalibur\u0026rdquo; that can reproduce the sensation of holding various virtual objects by moving the positions of the two weights.\nThe relationship between the position of the weight and the perceived shape of the device is formulated using a data-driven method to optimize the position of the weight of the device for the appearance of a given virtual object.\nVideo   Hardware By moving the two weighted modules in polar coordinates in a two-dimensional plane, Transcalibur changes its own moment of inertia.  \nComputational Perception Model In order to generate real sensations with various objects in the virtual environment, it is necessary to know the relationship between the \u0026ldquo;position of the weight\u0026rdquo; and the \u0026ldquo;shape that humans actually perceive\u0026rdquo;.
