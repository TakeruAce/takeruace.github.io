# Concepts
The shape of a grasped object that humans perceive haptically is affected by the object's impedance. 
In this project, we have developed a handheld VR controller "MetamorphX" that can reproduce the impedance of various virtual objects.
MetamorphX generates torque in response to human movement.
We attempted to make the user perceive **dynamically** generated torque as a **static** property of the object.
